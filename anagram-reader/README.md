# Anagrams
Imagine you have a file containing words of the English alphabet. Write a program that takes this file as an input and writes all words from within the file that are anagrams of each other to the console, with those words that are anagrams grouped together.

Two words are anagrams of each other if they share the same letters, but in a different order (e.g. the words race, care).

Example: </br>
Lets assume we have a file containing the words </br>
Tree</br>
Race</br>
Bee</br>
Care</br>
Acre</br>
Mine</br>

The output would be one line with
Tree Care Acre
